Oh, hey there! I am a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics. I am deeply interested in Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and their intersections. I love NLP, Algorithms, Complexity Theory, Information Theory, and Math as a whole. In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, going down [YouTube rabbit roles](http://youtube.com), playing sports, and [travelling the world](https://earthroulette.com/).
