Oh, hey there! I am a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics. I am deeply interested in **Machine Learning**, **Quantum Computing**, and their [intersections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09347). 

I also love **Natural Language Processing**, **Algorithms**, **Computational Complexity**, **Information Theory**, and **Math** as a whole. In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, writing blogs on various topics, going down YouTube rabbit holes, playing sports, and travelling the world.

Thank you for visiting my website ðŸ˜Ž
