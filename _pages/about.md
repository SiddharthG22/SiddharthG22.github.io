Oh, hey there! I am a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics. I am deeply interested in **Machine Learning** (particularly Natural Language Processing), **Quantum Computing**, and their [intersections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09347). 

I am also passionate about **Theoretical CS** as a whole and **Programming Language Design**. In my free time, I enjoy learning new (human) languages, [writing](blog), film photography, going down YouTube rabbit holes, and staying active through sports and hiking.

Go Bears! 🐻🚀
